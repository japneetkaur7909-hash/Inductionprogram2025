 ## Day 3 

 ## Expert Lecture By Dr. Jaswinder Singh (Incharge-IAPT)

 The day commenced with an enlightening address by Dr. Jaswinder Singh in the college auditorium. Instead of beginning with facts or theory, he invited everyone to shut their eyes and quietly look inward. 
 The purpose was to make us experience inner silence and self-awareness. When the exercise ended, students shared strikingly different insights- one felt the mind was restless, another had a vision of 
 Guru Nanak Dev Ji, someone imagined their future success, another visualized space, one recalled Shiv Ji, while another concentrated only on the point between the eyes. 
 Dr.Singh skillfully wove those experiences into a dialogue between science and spirituality. Quoting from *Japji Sahib-"Kita pasaoeko kawaao, tis te hoye lakh dariyaao"*-he explained its profound 
 meaning, connecting it to universal vibrations. He demonstated how vibrations exist even in everyday acts such as clapping, which can create energy strong enough to remove bacteria. In this way, he
 introduced innovative approaches to meditation while sharing experiments from his own journey of self exploration. 
 He also spoke about how he gradually developed his ability as a speaker. Every stage opportunity, he said, was like an examination where he gave his best . Over time, this practice brought **confidence and       joy.** He expressed gratitude to **GNDEC Faculty** and reminded us that, as newcomers, we are fortunate to be mentored by such dedicated teachers. 
 Toward the end, he narrated a powerful story of a girl in a job interview. On being asked her father's name, she responded truthfully. The interviewer stood up and instantly selected her. Walking out, she        thought to herself, *"Papa, you are great. I never understood you before, but today I do."* This tale beautifully conveyedhis core message - living with honesty, being self aware, and valuing the quiet but 
 strong support of our loved ones.


 ## Expert Lecture By Dr. Priya Darshni on "Universal Human Values" 

 The second session of the day was conducted by Dr. Priya Darshni, who spoke on the vital themeof *Universal Human Values*. Unlike lectures that simply provide information, her session felt more like a 
 gentle reminder of how we ought to live. She explained that values are not abstract concepts; they are living principles that guide our everyday choices and interactions. She highlighted how respect 
 creates harmony in relationships, emapathy allows us to truly understand others, and trust forms the foundation of all meaningful connections. These qualities, she  noted, are just as essesntial
 in our careers as they are in our personal lives, because they shape the kind of professionals and human beings we become. 
 Dr. Darshni also pointed out that values are not taught only in classrooms-they are practiced in how we greet someone, how we respond in difficult situations, and how we carry ourselves when no one is
 watching. She urged us to see values not as a rulebook but as a compass, always pointing us toward the right direction. 
 The tone of her talk was calm yet powerful, making us pause and reflect. By the end, it felt less like a lecture and more like a mirror held up to our own actions. She left us with the thought that living 
 by universal values is not just about improving society-it is about becoming a more complete, balanced, and compassionate version of ourselves.

## Day 4

## Session by Dr. Priya Darshni on Universal Human Values-2 

The afternon began with Dr. Darshni's continuation of her series on *Universal Human Values.* Instead of repeating earlier points, she pushed us into deeper waters-exploring the idea of 
*Right Understaning.* To explain, she drew a simple yet poowerful contrast: animals are content once their physical needs are satisfied, but humans cannot stop there. We need food, shelter,
and safety, yes-but also clarity, meaningful relationships, and inner balance to live joyfully. 
She reminded us that wealth and comfort alone do not promise peace. A prson can own every luxury and still restless if trust and respect are missing. On the other hand, life can feel full even 
with fewer resources, provided there is understanding and harmony.She warned that when our thoughts and values lack calrity, we may unknowingly spread unhappiness to those around us.
At a point, she gently paused and asked: *"In your busy day, how often do you pause to reflect on yourself, your relationships, and the harmony you create?"* That question lingered in the room.
We all realised that we dedicate hours to academics and tasks, but barely any time to self-reflection. Her closing message was clear- growthis not just about marks or achievements, but about cultivating
empathy, clarity, and respect for others. 
Her talk felt less like a lecture and more like an awakening- simple words that quietly nudged us to rethink how we live. 


## Causmic Cub Introduction 

Later, from 3:00 to 4:00 pm, the atmosphere shifter as the **CAUSMIC CLUB** took the stage. Their very name caught attention - *Causmic*, a blend of *"cause"* and *"cosmos"*, *"symbolizing"* limitless
ideas tied to purposeful action. 
The members introduced themselves with infectious enthusiasm and shared the club's vision: to be a space where creativity, discussions and innovation come  together. They walked us through the variety 
of events they've hosted-**ACME, APEX, Genconian Craft Prix, Bachelor Buddies, and Ambit Youth Parliament.** Each event had its own flavor, ranging from technical competitions to cultural showcases and 
thought-provoking debates. What stood out most was the inclusivity- the club is not bound by departments or seniority; it thrives on diversity. 
But their real emphasis was not on attending events, but on *creating* them. They spoke about teamwork, leadership, and learning from real challenges-how every member gets the chance to design, organize
and execute ideas. This, they said, is what transforms students into confident individuals ready for bigger roles in life. 
The room was charged with their passion. It didn't feel like a routine introduction; it felt like an invitation to step into something bigger. By the end, many of us were no longer just listeners-we
were already imagining ourselves as future members of Causmic.

## Day 6 - Induction Program Proceedings 

The sixth day of the induction program opened with an inspiring interaction led by **Sardar Gurcharan Singh Grewal, member of SGPC.** Greetings everyone with a warm *"Fateh,"* he immediately set the tone by
assuring that his session would be a dialogue rather than a lecture. His approachable style made the atmospehre lively and welcoming.
Mr. Grewal encouraged us to remain on the right path, reassuring us that joining GNE was already a wise decision. On a personal note, he mentioned how he once aspired to study at this very institution, making his words even more heartfelt. Before concluding, he invited students to share their reflections on the induction journey so far, turning the session into a truly interactive experience.

The next session was conducted by Dr. Lakhvir Singh Khana (Incharge – CML, SWAYAM–NPTEL Coordinator), who introduced us to the government-supported platforms SWAYAM and NPTEL. He explained their value as open learning platforms where courses are taught by IIT professors and cover a vast range of subjects.
Dr. Khana especially emphasized the importance of enrolling in NPTEL courses since they align closely with our academic requirements. During the session, we even created our own accounts on the platform. Later, while exploring the portal, I personally enrolled in the course Developing Soft Skills and Personality—something I am genuinely enthusiastic about pursuing.

The day concluded with a short but impactful session by Mr. Arvind Dhingra (Director – STEP & Incharge – TAC). Observing that some students were growing restless, he kept his talk concise and to the point. His central message was clear: “Only when you pursue something with passion can you truly succeed.”
To lighten the mood, he engaged us with a playful activity, asking for the last letter of the English alphabet. When a student responded with “A,” he cheerfully accepted it, turning the moment into a humorous icebreaker. Though brief, his last minute talk address was energetic, engaging, and served as a refreshing close to the day's sessions.
