# GNDEC Induction Program 2025 – Daily Reflections

This repository documents my daily reflections and learnings from the Student Induction Program 2025 at **Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College (GNDEC), Ludhiana**.

The induction program is designed to help students transition smoothly into college life, understand the institutional culture, and develop a foundation for personal and academic growth. Each day brings new opportunities to learn, explore, and grow. Through this log, I aim to record key moments, experiences, and takeaways.
